## 📖 Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase the ability to build a full-stack application using Django for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. As a part of the Meduzzen internship, this project will cover various aspects of web development, from setting up the environment to deploying the final application.

## 🚀 Running the Application

1. **Install the required packages:**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. **Run the Django development server:**:
    ```bash
    ./manage.py runserver
**Note:** Django 4.2.5, hot-reloading upon file changes is built-in, so there's no need for additional setup for this feature.

## 🧪 Running Tests
