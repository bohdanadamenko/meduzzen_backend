  - ![Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Django-092E20?style=flat-square&logo=Django&logoColor=white)
  
- **Frontend**: 
  - ![Vue.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Vue.js-4FC08D?style=flat-square&logo=Vue.js&logoColor=white)

## üìñ Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase the ability to build a full-stack application using Django for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. As a part of the Meduzzen internship, this project will cover various aspects of web development, from setting up the environment to deploying the final application.

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. **Install the required packages:**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
Or rename, if you prefer.

3. **Run the Django development server:**:
    ```bash
    ./manage.py runserver
**Note:** Django hot-reloading upon file changes is built-in, so there's no need for additional setup for this feature.

## üê≥ Run with Docker 
**Requirements**

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**To start** Docker container, run the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in a web browser

**Note:** The `start.sh` script is executed within the Docker container. This script is responsible for applying any pending db **migrations** and starting the Django application.

## üóÉ Database Migrations

### Local:
1. **Create Migrations:**
   ```bash
   ./manage.py makemigrations
2. **Apply Migrations:**
    ```bash
    ./manage.py migrate
### Docker:
1. **Create Migrations:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec django ./manage.py makemigrations
2. **Apply Migrations:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec django ./manage.py migrate
## üß™ Running Tests
In your local Python environment:

    ./manage.py test

Inside Docker container:

    docker-compose run django python manage.py test

## üóÑ Logging

Logging is set up to output messages to the console, with a logging level of `DEBUG` for development purposes. Please refer to the `settings.py` for detailed logging configurations.

**NOTE:** Messages of `WARNING` level and above are additionally recorded to `warning.log` located in the `/logs/` directory.

## üîë Auth0 Login / Registration

Log in or register http://localhost:8000/auth/login/auth0/ You can use existing credentials or create a new account, with the option to use **Google** or **Facebook** for login.

# üè¢ Company Management API

This section of the API allows users to perform CRUD operations on companies. Below are the endpoints available and how to interact with them.

## üåê Endpoints

- `POST /companies/create/`: Create a new company.
- `GET /companies/`: Retrieve a list of all companies.
- `GET /companies/<int:pk>/`: Retrieve the details of a specific company.
- `PATCH /companies/<int:pk>/`: Update a specific company's information.
- `DELETE /companies/<int:pk>/`: Delete a specific company.

## Usage

### ‚ûï Creating a Company

To create a new company, send a POST request with the required data.

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Token <your_token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Company Name", "description": "Company Description"}' http://localhost:8000/companies/create/
```

### üîç Retrieving Companies
To retrieve all companies, send a GET request.

```sh
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Token <your_token>" http://localhost:8000/companies/
```
To retrieve a specific company, include the company's ID in the request.


```
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Token <your_token>" http://localhost:8000/companies/<company_id>/
```
### ‚úèÔ∏è Updating a Company
To update a company's information, send a PATCH request with the updated data.

```
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Token <your_token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "New Company Name"}' http://localhost:8000/companies/<company_id>/
```

### ‚ùå Deleting a Company
To delete a company, send a DELETE request.

```
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Token <your_token>" http://localhost:8000/companies/<company_id>/
```
### üëÄ Company Visibility
By default, new companies are visible to all. To hide your company, set the 'is_visible' parameter to false:
```
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Token <your_token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"is_visible":false}' http://localhost:8000/companies/<company_id>/
```
